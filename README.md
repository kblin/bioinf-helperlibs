Helperlibs README
=================

[![Build Status](http://github.drone.secondarymetabolites.org/api/badges/kblin/bioinf-helperlibs/status.svg)](http://github.drone.secondarymetabolites.org/kblin/bioinf-helperlibs)

This library is a collection of Bioinformatics-related helper functions
that I have created in the course of writing bioinformatics tools.

If I find that I want to reuse a bit of code in multiple projects, the code
usually ends up in this helper library

**Note**: Version 0.1.12 is the last version to support Python 2.7, due to our
dependencies dropping support for Python 2.

Quickstart
----------

The quickest way to get started using the helperlibs is to dump the helperlibs
folder in the top level directory for your project.

Of course you can also install it in your Python path, by using
`pip install helperlibs` for the latest stable release or
`pip install git+git://github.com/kblin/bioinf-helperlibs.git` for the lastest
code from git.
